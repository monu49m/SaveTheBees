Hello !!!
My name is Monika Meshram studying MA705 - Data Science course (spring 2022).

This file is about the individual project using almost all concepts learned during the course. I have made interactive dashboard using python DASH.
This interactive dashboard displays information about Beekeeping (Apiculture), which is maintenance of bee colonies, commonly in man-made hives.
It offers visualization of loss of bee colonies as a focus. User can choose reported annual period and region(s) to visualize the annual percentage 
loss of bee colonies and also number of beekeepers and colonies statistics per year and state-wise. There may be many reasons for the loss like diseases
in bees, finance and maintenance problem etc. which is out-of-scope of this visualization dashboard.

Here is a list of data sources and references used in this course project:
- Bee Colony Loss information: https://data.world/finley/bee-colony-statistical-data-from-1987-2017
- USA state code: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/corochann/usa-state-code
- Dash Plotly Callbacks: https://dash.plotly.com/datatable/callbacks
- Dash Plotly Choropleth maps: https://plotly.com/python/choropleth-maps
- Dash Plotly Line charts: https://plotly.com/python/line-charts

My program flow goes as:
- Reading .csv files
- Data cleaning & data wrangling
- Creating required dataframe
- Creating required app layout which includes 3 figues: 1 choropleth map & 2 line charts
